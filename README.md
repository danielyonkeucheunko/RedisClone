# C++ CMake Template

This is a template repository for a C++ project using CMake. It includes a basic folder structure, a build script, and strict compiler warning settings.

## Project Structure

-   `src/` - Source files (`.cpp`)
-   `include/` - Header files (`.h`)
-   `run.sh` - Shell script to configure, build, and run the project
-   `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake configuration
-   `build/` - Build output folder (generated by CMake)
